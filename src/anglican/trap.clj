;;;; Trampoline-ready Anglican program

;; The input to this transformations is an Anglican program in
;; clojure syntax (anglican.xlat). The output is a Clojure function
;; that returns either the next step as a structure incroprorating
;; continuations and parameters, or the state containing a vector of
;; predicted values and the sample weight.
;;
;; Steps are delimited by random choices.  Between the steps, the
;; inference decisions can be made.
;;
;; The state is threaded through computation and consists of
;;   - the running sample weight
;;   - the list of predicted values.
