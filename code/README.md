# embang

embang, or __m!__, is a probabilistic programming system
implemented in Clojure, both the programming environment and
the language. [Introduction to __m!__](doc/intro.md) explains
how to write and run programs in __m!__.

You are welcome to write programs which call inference,
as well as extend __m!__ with new algorithms,
propose changes, and fix bugs. Consult the [developer
guide](doc/devel.md) for details.

[The code map](doc/codemap.md) provides a quick guide around
the source code layout, as well as contains a list of implemented
inference algorithms.
