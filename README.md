# Anglican

Anglican is a probabilistic programming system
implemented in Clojure, both the programming environment and
the language. [Introduction to Anglican](doc/intro.md) explains
how to write and run programs in anglican.

Everyone is welcome to write programs which call inference,
as well as to extend anglican with new algorithms,
propose changes, and fix bugs. Consult the [developer
guide](doc/devel.md) for details.

[The code map](doc/codemap.md) provides a quick guide around
the source code layout, as well as contains a list of implemented
inference algorithms.
